# Machine_Learning
In this section, I will put and update my machine learning related codes:

*k_means_clustering.ipynb:
the dataset I used is "Mall_Customers.csv" which I had to cluster the spending-score of the customers of a mall based on their annual income, and then rate the customers as careful, careless or best target for the mall!

*dog_cat_images_CNN_classification_project.ipynb:
you can either email me to send you my own dataset of cats and dogs images, or you can use anyyyy other dataset of your own with binary classification, such as a dangrous/benighn tumor. The code will work fine regardless of what kind of imag data you feed it, but you probably need to add slight changes in my code where I have mentioned the "size" of my own dataset, and substitute your dataset's size.
