<b> *Notes:</b>

Q) For which models we MUST use Feature Scaling?

A) up untill now, we do not have to use it for "Simple/Multiple/Polynomial Regression". We aslo DO NOT use it for "Decision Tree / Random Forest Regression" becase it doesn't make any sense since these models are based on simply splitting the data over and over and are not based on a special mathematical equation. We aslo do not have to 'necessarily use it for "Logistic Regression Classification" but employing it will improve the performance of it (So I used it in my model).

But, we HAVE TO use it for "SVR Regression".

# Machine_Learning
In this section, I will put and update my machine learning related codes:

<b>* k_means_clustering.ipynb:</b>

the dataset I used is "Mall_Customers.csv" which I had to cluster the spending-score of the customers of a mall based on their annual income, and then rate the customers as careful, careless or best target for the mall!


<b>* dog_cat_images_CNN_classification_project.ipynb:</b>

you can either email me to send you my own dataset of cats and dogs images, or you can use anyyyy other dataset of your own with binary classification, such as a dangrous/benighn tumor. The code will work fine regardless of what kind of imag data you feed it, but you probably need to add slight changes in my code where I have mentioned the "size" of my own dataset, and substitute your dataset's size.


<b>* logistic_regression_classification_social_network_ads.ipynb:</b>

The dataset is "Social_Network_Ads.csv", and this code predicts if costumers will buy a prodcut, and the code works for annnnnny advertisement/classification dataset.

<b> *naive bayes_classification.ipynb:</b>

The dataset is "Social_Network_Ads.csv", and this code predicts if costumers will buy a prodcut.

<b> *decision_tree_classification_social_network_ads.ipynb:</b>

The dataset is "Social_Network_Ads.csv", and this code predicts if costumers will buy a prodcut.

<b> *03_Data Preprocessing_costumers.ipynb:</b>

The dataset is "Data.csv", but the goal in here was the "Data Preprecessing" process, not the dataset.

<b> *06_Regression_Simple Linear Regression.ipynb:</b>

The dataset is "Salary_Data.csv".

<b> *07_Regression_Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb:</b>

The dataset is "50_Startups.csv".

<b> *08_Regression_Polynomial Regression.ipynb:</b>

The dataset is "Position_Salaries.csv".

<b> *09_Regression_SVR.ipynb:</b>

The dataset is "Position_Salaries.csv".

<b> *10_Regression_Decision Tree Regression.ipynb:</b>
  
  The dataset is "Position_Salaries.csv".
  
  <b> *11_Regression_Random Forest Regression.ipynb:</b>
  
  The dataset is "Position_Salaries.csv".
  
  <b> *All the codes in part 13:</b>
  
  The dataset is "Data.csv".
  
  <b> *16_Classification_Logistic Regression_Social Nework Ads.ipynb:</b>
  
  The dataset is "Social_Network_Ads.csv". The features are "Age" and "Salary" and based on these two indepandant variables, we ant to see if a user purchsed the product or not, according to label "Purchased".
